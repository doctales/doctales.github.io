            <li class="li">DITA enforces <strong class="ph b">structured authoring</strong>, which results in a good document
                structure.</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA facilitates <strong class="ph b">content re-use</strong>, which leads to less duplicated content.</li>

                outputs.</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA <strong class="ph b">reduces translation costs</strong>, because less content has to be
                translated.</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA is <strong class="ph b">extendable</strong> due to specializations and therefore can easily be adapted
                to customer needs.</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA is <strong class="ph b">scalable</strong> and can be used by a single author on a single machine or by
                hundreds of authors in a complex authoring environment with multiple publishing
                servers.</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA is effective for <strong class="ph b">collaboration</strong>, because DITA files can be shared in
                version control systems like Git or in a CMS.</li>

                features.</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA can be <strong class="ph b">converted</strong> in all major output formats, e.g. HTML5 or PDF</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA <strong class="ph b">seperates content from presentation</strong> and therefore can easily converted
                to new output formats like, for example, responsive HTML5.</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA ensures <strong class="ph b">structural integrity</strong>, because it is based on XML which can be
                validated.</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA <strong class="ph b">separetes content</strong> (topics) <strong class="ph b">from context</strong> (maps).</li>
        
            <li class="li">DITA is an <strong class="ph b">open standard</strong> (not proprietary) and is not relying on specific
                tools.</li>
